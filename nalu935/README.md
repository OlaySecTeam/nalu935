I used to see these niggas on my twitter feed man,

[Crystal Sec](http://www.twitter.com/crystalsec_) well known to start shit
Pistol on me nigga, ain't no picking on me
A dark ally is where your body will lay
Heard Barack Obama whisper asalaam alaikum
Came to the realization that your “exploits” were fake, damn..

you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them exploits
I used to be friends with you niggas
Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
I'm gonna bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of devices,
This little thing of ours,
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush you
That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick
Rap game, so much fuck shit done
That's why this .45 in my boxers
Shots fired, home invasion coming quick
Red beam detonators, whos the bomb now?
Look you in your eyes nigga, before I say good night
pray that those exploits get to see the day of light

Damn, [ItzGeb](http://www.twitter.com/ItzGeb) & [pythonsn0w](http://www.twitter.com/pythonsn0w), I use to be friends with you niggas,
Hate that it came to this..

Shootin' dope, using coke, selling bricks acting like you the Folks
Sacrificin' half your lifes for your gay cult
I pray you find the kindness in your heart
I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame
Last request, can all bugs please get disclosed?

Can't believe this shit homie,
How the fuck nigga, you touch my code nigga?
And what hurt me the most nigga,
Is how you did me like that nigga.
I was loyal to you niggas,
You put my nigga [sn0wFX](http://www.twitter.com/sn0wFX) in the hole, homie.
I don't feel you for that my nigga,
That shit hurt me, you understand me?
It's painful what you see what you niggas would do.
